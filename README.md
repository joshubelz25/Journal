<p>Repository(repo):A software repository, or repo for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, along with metadata. A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers. Package managers allow automatically installing and updating repositories.<p>

<p> Git:Git (/ɡɪt/) is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
</p>

<p> Github:At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles.</p>

<p> CLI (command line interface):A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
</p>

<p> Terminal:A terminal is a text input and output environment. It is a program that acts as a wrapper and allows us to enter commands that the computer processes. In plain English again, it's the "window" in which you enter the actual commands your computer will process. Keep in mind the terminal is a program, just like any other.</p>

<p> GUI(Graphical User interface):A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system.</p>

<p> IDE:An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<p> VS code:Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>

<p> Abstraction:Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming. Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.</p>
<p> A reset stylesheet is a collection of CSS rules used to clear the browser's default formatting of HTML elements, removing potential inconsistencies between different browsers.</p>
<p>User-agent, or browsers, have basic style sheets that give default styles to any document. These style sheets are named user-agent stylesheets. Most browsers use actual stylesheets for this purpose, while others simulate them in code.</p>
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
<p> Subject to, implying, or dependent upon a condition a conditional promise. 2 : expressing, containing, or implying a supposition the conditional clause if he speaks. 3a : true only for certain values of the variables or symbols involved conditional equations.</p>
<p>In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically. Common simple examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.</p>
<p>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.</p>
<p>An assignment operator is the operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element in C# programming language. Assignment operators can also be used for logical operations such as bitwise logical operations or operations on integral operands and Boolean operands.</p>
<p>Most programming languages have a data type called a string, which is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as "hello world". A string can contain any sequence of characters, visible or invisible, and characters may be repeated.</p>
<p>Alternatively referred to as literal(s), a literal string is several characters enclosed in double or single quotes, depending on the programming language or command line. A program does not interpret characters in a literal string until it encounters the next double or single quote. </p>
<p> Literals or constants are the values we write in a conventional form whose value is obvious. In contrast to variables, literals (123, 4.3, "hi") do not change in value. These are also called explicit constants or manifest constants.</p>
<p>A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task.</p>
<p>An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.</p>
<p>A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
<p>These operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo).</p>
