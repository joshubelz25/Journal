<p>Repository(repo):A software repository, or repo for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, along with metadata. A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers. Package managers allow automatically installing and updating repositories.<p>

<p> Git:Git (/ɡɪt/) is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
</p>

<p> Github:At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles.</p>

<p> CLI (command line interface):A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
</p>

<p> Terminal:A terminal is a text input and output environment. It is a program that acts as a wrapper and allows us to enter commands that the computer processes. In plain English again, it's the "window" in which you enter the actual commands your computer will process. Keep in mind the terminal is a program, just like any other.</p>

<p> GUI(Graphical User interface):A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system.</p>

<p> IDE:An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<p> VS code:Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>

<p> Abstraction:Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming. Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.</p>
<p> A reset stylesheet is a collection of CSS rules used to clear the browser's default formatting of HTML elements, removing potential inconsistencies between different browsers.</p>
<p>User-agent, or browsers, have basic style sheets that give default styles to any document. These style sheets are named user-agent stylesheets. Most browsers use actual stylesheets for this purpose, while others simulate them in code.</p>
